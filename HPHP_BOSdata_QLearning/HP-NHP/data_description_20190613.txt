Quick documentation of data format: 

This mat file contains a number of variables relevant for some of our analyses, most can be safely ignored, the following variables however will be required:


1) info:
This contains information useful to find the matching session folder (with all original log & tracker files)

2) TrialsInCurrentSetIdx:
is the set of trial indices for successful/rewarded trials in dual mode (with two active participants).

(IGNORE FOR NOW:
for completness, this set was calculated as shown below:
    TrialsInCurrentSetIdx = intersect(TrialSets.ByOutcome.REWARD, TrialSets.ByChoices.NumChoices02);		% exclude trials with only one target (instructed reach, informed reach)
    TrialsInCurrentSetIdx = intersect(TrialsInCurrentSetIdx, TrialSets.ByTrialType.InformedTrials);             % exclude free choice
    TrialsInCurrentSetIdx = intersect(TrialsInCurrentSetIdx, TrialSets.ByJointness.DualSubjectJointTrials);     % exclude non-joint trials

TrialSets:
A structure that contains list of trial indices for trials in which specific conditions were met. 
E.g. TrialSets.ByOutcome.REWARD contains a list of trials in which reward was dispensed, aka successful trials. 
)


3) FullPerTrialStruct:
This contains a number of arrays giving the value of one parameter per trial. 
To extract the data for the subset of dual, rewarded, completed trials use TrialsInCurrentSetIdx

Example 1: trials where the view was blocked
isTrialInvisible_AB = FullPerTrialStruct.isTrialInvisible_AB(TrialsInCurrentSetIdx); 

Example 2: extract sequence of selection outcomes for dual, rewarded, completed trials
(4,3,2,1, where 4 mean both selected A pref. target,  3 - both selected B pref. target, 2 - each selected own pref. target, 1 - each selected own nonpreferred target)

is_red_trial	= PreferableTargetSelected_A & NonPreferableTargetSelected_B;
is_blue_trial	= NonPreferableTargetSelected_A & PreferableTargetSelected_B;
is_pink_trial	= PreferableTargetSelected_A & PreferableTargetSelected_B;
is_green_trial	= NonPreferableTargetSelected_A & NonPreferableTargetSelected_B;

all_trials_by_joint_combination = is_green_trial*1 + is_pink_trial*2 + is_blue_trial*3 + is_red_trial*4;
trials_by_joint_combination	= all_trials_by_joint_combination(TrialsInCurrentSetIdx);


Here is a full list of the members of FullPerTrialStruct structure:

         A_IniTargRel_05MT_RT: double: time (ms) from choice-target onset to halfway between release of initial-fixation-target and acquisition of choice-target for agent A
         B_IniTargRel_05MT_RT: double: time (ms) from choice-target onset to halfway between release of initial-fixation-target and acquisition of choice-target for agent B
         AB_IniTargRel_05MT_RT_diff: double: time difference (ms) A_IniTargRel_05MT_RT - B_IniTargRel_05MT_RT
        
         AB_TrialStartTimeMS: double: time (ms) start time of trials relative to experimemt start (0.0, negative values are permitted and denote start-up phase of eventIDE)
         RewardByTrial_A: int: number of reward units earned by agent A
         RewardByTrial_B: int: number of reward units earned by agent B
        
         % note there are trial types in some sessions with only one target displayed, so (LeftTargetSelected_A = ~ RightTargetSelected_A) is not generally valid for each trial
         PreferableTargetSelected_A: bool: 1 if prefereable target was selected by agent A
         PreferableTargetSelected_B: bool: 1 if prefereable target was selected by agent B
         NonPreferableTargetSelected_A: bool: 1 if non-prefereable target was selected by agent A
         NonPreferableTargetSelected_B: bool: 1 if non-prefereable target was selected by agent B
         
	 % note there are trial types in some sessions with only one target displayed, so (NonPreferableTargetSelected_B = ~ PreferableTargetSelected_A) is not generally valid
         % due to the transparent screen there are two ways to describe the side a stimulus was presented, relative to the respective agent (which we call subjective below) or relative to the
	 % the front-side of the transparent screen (the side agent A is located)   
         LeftTargetSelected_A: bool: 1 if objective left target (seen from A) was selected by agent A
         LeftTargetSelected_B: bool: 1 if left target (seen from A) was selected by agent B
         RightTargetSelected_A: bool: 1 if right (seen from A) target was selected by agent A
         RightTargetSelected_B: bool: 1 if right (seen from A) target was selected by agent B
    
         SubjectiveLeftTargetSelected_A: bool: 1 if subjective left target (seen from A) was selected by agent A
         SubjectiveLeftTargetSelected_B: bool: 1 if subjective left target (seen from B) was selected by agent B
         SubjectiveRightTargetSelected_A: bool: 1 if subjective right target (seen from A) was selected by agent A
         SubjectiveRightTargetSelected_B: bool: 1 if subjective right target (seen from A) was selected by agent A
                
         TrialIsJoint: bool: 1 if both agents had to participate in a trial
         TrialIsSolo: bool: 1 if only one agent had to participate in a trial
         NumChoiceTargetsPerTrial: int: number of choice-targets in a trial (to help separate out dual target informed-choice from single target informed-instructed-reach trias)
         TrialIsRewarded: bool: 1 if the trial was rewarded
         TrialIsAborted: bool: 1 if the trials was not rewarded but aborted instead
